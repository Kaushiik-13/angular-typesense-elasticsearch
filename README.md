# Angular + TypeSense + Elasticsearch: High-Performance Search Showcase

This project demonstrates a high-performance search engine interface built using **Angular** and powered by **TypeSense** and **Elasticsearch**, aimed at exploring fast filtering, faceting, and search capabilities on datasets with **millions to billions of records**.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

When working with large-scale product catalogs or datasets, traditional search systems often face performance issues‚Äîespecially with:

- Full-text search  
- Faceted filtering  
- Instant response times  

This project tackles these challenges using two popular search engines:

- **TypeSense** (an in-memory typo-tolerant search engine)
- **Elasticsearch** (a distributed full-text search engine)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular  
- **Search Engines**: TypeSense, Elasticsearch  
- **Containerization & Testing**: Docker  
- **Designs**: Figma *(not used in this project)*  
- **Backend**: Not applicable *(only APIs of TypeSense and Elasticsearch were used directly)*

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset used contains **billions of records** for simulating real-world product listings.

## ‚öîÔ∏è TypeSense vs Elasticsearch: Observations

| Feature                      | TypeSense                          | Elasticsearch                     |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Response Time**           | Lightning fast (~ms latency)       | Slightly slower under high load   |
| **Faceted Filtering**       | Built-in and intuitive             | Requires manual aggregation setup |
| **Ease of Setup**           | Minimal config, Docker ready       | Complex setup with cluster tuning |
| **Memory Usage**            | Higher (in-memory index)           | Optimized for disk-based storage  |
| **Typo Tolerance**          | Built-in, excellent for fuzzy      | Requires tuning fuzziness levels  |
| **Joins/Relational Queries**| Not natively supported (tried workaround joins) | Better support via nested fields |
| **Use Case Fit**            | Ideal for product search, instant filtering | Good for logs, analytics, large document search |

## üß™ Experimental Features

- ‚úÖ Tried implementing **TypeSense-style joins** (even though not natively supported)
- ‚úÖ Tested performance under **simulated production-scale data**
- ‚úÖ Compared query performance, indexing time, and memory footprint between both engines

## üìò Learnings: How TypeSense Works

- **In-Memory Indexing**: Keeps indexes in memory, making searches blazingly fast (in milliseconds)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Documents can be updated with very low latency, suitable for dynamic datasets
- **Faceted Search**: Built-in support for filters like category, price, rating ‚Äî similar to Amazon‚Äôs sidebar
- **Typo-Tolerance**: Automatically accounts for small spelling mistakes in queries
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Can scale with multiple replicas and read nodes
- **Compression**: Keeps memory usage efficient despite large-scale indexing
